Representation of Numbers
=========================

Integers and Real numbers with any number of digits, automatically tagging numerical precision when appropriate.

Precision is not "guarded" through the evaluation process. Only integer precision is supported.

However, things like :code:`N[Pi, 100]`  should work as expected.
