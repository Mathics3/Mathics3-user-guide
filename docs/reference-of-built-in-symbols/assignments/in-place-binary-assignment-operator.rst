In-place binary assignment operator
===================================

There are a number operators and functions that combine assignment with some sort of binary operator.

Sometimes a value is returned *before* the assignment occurs. When there is an operator for this, the operator is a prefix operator and the function name starts with :code:`Pre` .

Sometimes the binary operation occurs first, and *then* the assignment occurs. When there is an operator for this, the operator is a postfix operator.

Infix operators combined with assignment end in :code:`By` , :code:`From` , or :code:`To` .
