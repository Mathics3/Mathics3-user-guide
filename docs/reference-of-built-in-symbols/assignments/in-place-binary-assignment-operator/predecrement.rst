PreDecrement
============

`WMA link <https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/PreDecrement.html>`_


:code:`PreDecrement` [:math:`x`]
    same as

:code:`--` :math:`x`
    decrements :math:`x` by 1, returning the new value of :math:`x`.





:code:`--` :math:`a` is equivalent to :math:`a` :code:`=`  :math:`a` :code:`- 1` :

>>> a = 2;


>>> --a

    =
:math:`1`


>>> a

    =
:math:`1`



Compare with `Decrement </doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/assignments/in-place-binary-assignment-operator/decrement>`_ which returns the updated value, and `Increment </doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/assignments/in-place-binary-assignment-operator/increment>`_ which goes the other way.

>>> Clear[a]
    = `
