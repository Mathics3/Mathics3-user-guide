ClearTrace
==========


:code:`ClearTrace[]`
    Clear the statistics collected for Built-in Functions





First, set up Builtin-function tracing:

>>> $TraceBuiltins = True

    =
:math:`\text{True}`



Dump Builtin-Function statistics gathered in running that assignment:

>>> PrintTrace[]


>>> ClearTrace[]


>>> $TraceBuiltins = False
    = False`
