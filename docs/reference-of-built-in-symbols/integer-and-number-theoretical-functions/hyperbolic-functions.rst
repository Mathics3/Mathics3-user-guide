Hyperbolic Functions
====================

`Hyperbolic functions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_functions>`_ are analogues of the ordinary trigonometric functions, but defined using the hyperbola rather than the circle.

Numerical values and derivatives can be computed; however, most special exact values and simplification rules are not implemented yet.
