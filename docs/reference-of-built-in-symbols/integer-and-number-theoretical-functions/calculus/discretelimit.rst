`WMA link <https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/DiscreteLimit.html>`_


:code:`DiscreteLimit` [:math:`f`, :math:`k`->Infinity]
    gives the limit of the sequence :math:`f` as :math:`k` tends to infinity.





>>> DiscreteLimit[n/(n + 1), n -> Infinity]
    =

:math:`1`


>>> DiscreteLimit[f[n], n -> Infinity]
    =

:math:`f\left[\infty \right]`
