Functional Programming
======================

`Functional programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming>`_ is a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.

It is made richer by expressions like :math:`f`[:math:`x`] being treating as symbolic data.

This is term is often used in contrast to Procedural programming.
