Order Statistics
================

In statistics, an `order statistic <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_statistic>`_ gives the :math:`k`-th smallest value.

Together with `rank statistics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranking>`_ these are fundamental tools in non-parametric statistics and inference.

Important special cases of order statistics are finding minimum and maximum value of a sample and sample quantiles.
