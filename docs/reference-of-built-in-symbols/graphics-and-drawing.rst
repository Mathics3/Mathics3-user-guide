Graphics and Drawing
====================

Showing something visually can be done in a number of ways:



- Starting with complete images and modifying them using the :code:`Image`        Built-in function.

- Use pre-defined 2D or 3D objects like `:code:`Circle`  </doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/drawing-graphics/circle>`_ and `:code:`Cuboid`  </doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/graphics-and-drawing/three-dimensional-graphics/cuboid/>`_   and place them in a coordinate space.

- Compute the points of the space using a function. This is done using functions   like `:code:`Plot`  </doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/graphics-and-drawing/plotting-data/plot>`_   and `:code:`ListPlot`  </doc/reference-of-built-in-symbols/graphics-and-drawing/plotting-data/listplot>`_.
