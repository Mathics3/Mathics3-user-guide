Mathematical Optimization
=========================

Mathematical optimization is the selection of a best element, with regard to some criterion, from some set of available alternatives.

Optimization problems of sorts arise in all quantitative disciplines from computer science and engineering to operations research and economics, and the development of solution methods has been of interest in mathematics for centuries.

We intend to provide local and global optimization techniques, both numeric and symbolic.
