Language Tutorial
=================

The following sections are introductions to the basic principles of the language of \Mathics. A few examples and functions are presented. Only their most common usages are listed; for a full description of a Symbol's possible arguments, options, etc., see its entry in the Reference of Built-in Symbols.

However, if you google for "Mathematica Tutorials" you will find easily dozens of other tutorials that are applicable. For example, see `An Elementary Introduction to the Wolfram Language <https://www.wolfram.com/language/elementary-introduction/>`_. In the `docker image that we supply <https://hub.docker.com/r/mathicsorg/mathics>`_, you can load "workspaces" containing the examples described in the chapters of this introduction.

Be warned though that \Mathics does not yet offer the full range and features and capabilities of \Mathematica.
