Saving, Loading, and Deleting Worksheets
========================================

<subsection title="Saving Worksheets">

Worksheets exist in the browser window only and are not stored on the server, by default. To save all your queries and results, use the `<Save>`_ button which is the middle graphic of the menu bar. It looks like this:

Depending on browser, desktop, and OS-settings, the "Ctrl+S" key combination may do the same thing.

<subsection title="Loading and Deleting Worksheets">

Saved worksheets can be loaded or deleted using the `<File Open>`_ button which is the left-most button in the menu bar. It looks like this:

Depending on browser, desktop, and OS-settings, the "Ctrl+O" key combination may do the same thing.

A pop-up menu should appear with the list of saved worksheets with an option to either load or delete the worksheet.
