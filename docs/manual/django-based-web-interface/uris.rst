URIs
====

For the most part, the application is a single-page application.
Assuming your are running locally or on a host called :code:`localhost`  using the default port, 8000, here are some URLs and what they do:


`http://localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`_
    The single-page application; the main page.

`http://localhost:8000/about <http://localhost:8000/about>`_
    A page giving:
    

    - the software versions of this package and version information of important software this uses.
    
- directory path information for the current setup
    
- machine information
    
- system information
    
- customizable system settings
    



`http://localhost:8000/doc <http://localhost:8000/doc>`_
    An on-line formatted version of the documentation, which include this text. You can see this as a right side frame of the main page, when clicking "?" on the right-hand upper corner.
