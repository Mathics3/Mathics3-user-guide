What is missing?
================

There are lots of ways in which \Mathics could still be improved. ` :code:`FUTURE.rst`  <https://github.com/Mathics3/mathics-core/blob/master/FUTURE.rst>`_ has the current roadmap.

We always could use help in Python programming and improving the documentation. But there are other ways to help. For example:



- Ensure this document is complete and accurate. We could use help to ensure all of the Builtin functions are described properly and fully, and that they have a link to corresponding Wiki, SymPy, WMA and/or mpath links.
Make sure the builtin summaries and examples are clear and useful.

- We could use help in LaTeX styling, and going over this document to remove overfull boxes and things of that nature. We could also use help and our use of Asymptote. The are some graphics primitives such as for polyhedra that haven't been implemented. Similar graphics options are sometimes missing in Asymptote that we have available in other graphics backends.


- add another graphics backend: it could be a javascript library like jsfiddle


- Consider donating via `Github Sponsors <https://github.com/sponsors>`_ or some other mechanism.
