Why try to recreate Wolfram Language?
=====================================

\Mathematica is great, but it has a couple of disadvantages.



- It is not open source.

- Its development is tightly controlled and centralized and as such

- It can't hook into different kinds of open-source packages that have independently developed algorithms and methods




The second point some may find an advantage.

However, even if you are willing to pay hundreds of dollars for the software, you would not be able to see what's going on "inside" the program if that is your interest. That's what free, open-source, and community-supported software is for!

\Mathics combines the beauty of \Mathematica implemented in an open-source environment written in Python. The Python ecosystem includes libraries and tools like:



- `mpmath <https://mpmath.org/>`_ for floating-point arithmetic with arbitrary precision,

- `NumPy <https://numpy.org>`_ for numeric computation,

- `SymPy <https://sympy.org>`_ for symbolic mathematics, and

- `SciPy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_ for Scientific calculations.




Performance of \Mathics is not, right now, practical in large-scale projects and calculations. However, it can be used as a tool for exploration and education. There is promise that it can provide better debugging.
